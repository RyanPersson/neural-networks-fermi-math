# neural-networks-fermi-math
Just some quick jupyter notebook scratchwork estimating the computational power of biological neural networks in FLOPS


Josiah, the conda env I had you create the other day, `linear-algebra-class`, will work for this notebook.


Otherwise run via:
1. `conda env create --file environment.yml`

2. `conda activate math-playground`

3. `jupyter notebook`

4. Copy/paste the generated localhost URL in your browser.
